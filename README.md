# WomensRightsOperationProject2
My project is about womens rights, especially those in my generation Gen Z. I chose to use a operation board as a visual for this to help reflect the disection that my site does to the different topics within womens rights. I have five pieces for my operation game, a uterus to represent reproductive rights, a breast to represent sexualization and nudity, a purse to represent the wage gap, a heel to represent materialism and the idea of a womans "perfect image", and lastly a dumbbell to represent body image. On my sites interface you are allowed to drag and drop the pieces to their correct spots, while dragging th piece around the screen you encounter different challanging questions that pop up on the screen like, "Which will you pick?". Be careful though because if any of your pieces touch the others they will disappear.
