# WomensRightsOperationProject2
My project is about women’s rights, especially those in my generation Gen Z. I chose to use an operation board as a visual for this to help reflect the dissection that my site does to the different topics within women’s rights. I have five pieces for my operation game, a uterus to represent reproductive rights, a breast to represent sexualization and nudity, a purse to represent the wage gap, a heel to represent materialism and the idea of a woman’s "perfect image", and lastly a dumbbell to represent body image. On my sites interface you are allowed to drag and drop the pieces to their correct spots, while dragging the piece around the screen you encounter different challenging questions that pop up on the screen like, "Which will you pick?". Be careful if any of your pieces touch the others they will disappear, interactions like this change the meaning because like the piece changing so are women’s rights. This piece opens the floor for conversations on the change that needs to happen for women within policies and the internet.
